Welcome! 

The NetApp Instaclustr team is an active contributor to the open source community. Often, this takes the form of a contribution to existing open source projects but we also at times publish and maintain relevant work ourselves. We publish projects when we think they will be useful to the community. Not all open source projects we publish will be fully production-ready and covered by our customer support. Additional information on our supported projects can be found [here](https://www.instaclustr.com/support/documentation/useful-information/instaclustr-open-source-project-status/). 

 

Our code of conduct can be found [here](https://github.com/instaclustr/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). 

 

Finding your way 

* If you are looking to transparently intercept a database call and redirect it, check out [Shotover](https://shotover.io).  

* Find example code illustrating the use of the technologies we provide in [code-samples](https://github.com/instaclustr/code-samples).  

* As you build out your intelligent data infrastructure, take a look at our [NetApp Developer](https://www.netapp.com/developer) portal with links to additional NetApp APIs, documents, SDKs and infrastructure as code (IaC) resources. 

* For all open source projects other than archived, we welcome contributions in the form of pull requests (PRs) from any member of the community and will do our best to review PRs in a timely manner.  

* We also welcome all users to raise GitHub issues for any problems encountered and will action these as time and priorities permit.
